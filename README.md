# My process :

Built with 

- React : A front-end library / framework
- SASS : a CSS preprocessor
- Semantic HTML
- CSS media queries / font-face rules
- Slice Advice API

# What I learned :

Hello, so it's been a long time since I've posted a frontend solutions, I've been very busy so I'm glad to be able to post again!
So, I have learned a lot of things since the last time, but the two big new concepts here are : React and SASS.
I've learnt them through courses and actually through this challenge, which allowed me to put my knowledge into practice, and I think I've done pretty well.

- SASS is a CSS preprocessor that allows us to integrate concepts such as loops, conditions, etc... into our CSS, but it also brings a lot of other features that are very handy.
with CSS organisation.

- React is a well known library ( or framework ) to make the creation of UI easier with a lot of tools like props, state, components, etc... and also allow us to be well organised, like SASS for the CSS.

I also learned to use an API in a project, so that's good too.

# Continued development :

I need to expand my React knowledge by practising with different challenges.
I want to make a single page application, a larger scale application with React Router, and other exciting things!
I also need to learn how to use CSS frameworks like Tailwind to combine with SASS to improve my CSS skills.

# Useful ressources :

https://openclassrooms.com/fr/ : If you want to learn all sorts of things like : React, SASS, etc... I would really advise you to try this site, very interesting and well done !
